		<h1>My Favorite Pictures From Last Term</h1>
		<p>
			This project is for cs52's SA1. If you want to check out the cs52 webpage,
			you can find it <a href="https://cs52.me">HERE.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you would like to stay here, check out these
			<strong>super cool</strong> pictures! I took them while studying abroad in
			Cape Town last term! I am interested in medium format film and took a lot
			of pictures to learn more about it.
		</p>
		<p>Below is a short gallery of my favorites as I was learning.</p>
		<ol id="gallery">
			<li class="gallery-entry">
				<h2>Camps Bay Beach</h2>
				<img src="img/campsbay.jpg" height="400px" />
				<p>
					I took this picture on my last day in Cape Town. From this beach, you
					can see the 12 apostles of Table Mountain, but it was too cloudy to
					see them in this picture.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="gallery-entry">
				<h2>The Rock</h2>
				<img src="img/sunset.jpg" height="400px" />
				<p>
					I took this picture while watching the sunset from a place called "The
					Rock." A lot of people come here to picnic and watch the sunset! I
					didn't mean to take a picture of this couple but it worked out quite
					perfectly! I wish I could send this photo to them.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="gallery-entry">
				<h2>Sunrise Beach</h2>
				<img src="img/sunrisebeach.jpg" height="400px" />
				<p>
					I took this picture week 2 of the program. We wanted to explore all
					the beaches surrounding the city and found one called "Sunrise Beach."
					We did not make it there for sunrise, but it was so beautiful and
					nearly empty!
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="gallery-entry">
				<h2>South African Large Telescope</h2>
				<img src="img/salt.jpg" height="400px" />
				<p>
					This picture is not on film, but I wanted to include it because I love
					it. We visited the South African Large Telescope for a week to do
					observations - we would sleep during the day and stay up all night.
